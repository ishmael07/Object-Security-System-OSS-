Name: "Object Security System" (OSS)
Creators: Ishmael, Darshan, Adrian, Ari
Location: MIT BluePrint Hackathon 2023

Deacription: The Object Security System (OSS) is intended to highlight arduino's cybersecurity hardware capabilities.
It works by entering your password to power the whole system. Once the user enters their own dedicated password, they'll
be able to lock in an object and make sure nobody takes it. If someone tries to take it, an ample warning will be notified
once their hands get close to touching it, through the LCD Display & LEDs. If the person tries to grab it, an alarm will sound
and the owner will be notified. 

Materials: 

- Arduino Uno R3
- Piezo Speaker/Buzzer
- 2-3 LEDs (Red, Blue) 
- LCD Display (Usually LCD1602)
- Force Sensor (FSR) 
- Breadboard
- Ultrasonic Sensor 
- Jumper Wires
